    question: "Why pay for transfer.javascript.az when Quick Share is free?",
    answer:
      "Using transfer.javascript.az for free is already great for most people. However, if you are a professional or just want your files to be more accessible, you can pay for a subscription. This gives you access to the dashboard, and lets you share files that don't expire when you close the browser tab. The paid plan is also cheaper and faster than other sites like WeTransfer or Dropbox.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there really no file size limit?",
    answer:
      "There is no file size limit when using Quick Share, because the file is never stored on our servers. For transfers there are limits determined by your plan, because they will be stored on our servers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Quick-Share work?",
    answer:
      "It uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer data transfer, meaning the files are streamed directly between peers and not stored anywhere in the process, not even on transfer.javascript.az servers. To let peers initially discover each other, a signaling server is implemented in NodeJS using WebSockets, which importantly no sensitive data is sent through. In addition, the file data is end-to-end encrypted using AES-GCM with a client-side 256 bit generated key, meaning if someone could impersonate a peer or capture the traffic, they would not be able to decrypt the file without knowing the key. Because the file is streamed directly between peers, there are no file size or bandwidth limitations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is transfer.javascript.az safe to use?",
    answer:
      "Privacy and security is our top priority. The site was founded by an IT-security consultant, with many years of experience. Furthermore, your transfers are stored encrypted on our servers, meaning if an attacker could gain access to our servers hosting the files, they would not be able to steal your data.",

    question: "Is there a free trial available?",
    answer:
      "Not at the moment, it will be added in the future based on feedback.",

    question: "Can I cancel my account?",
